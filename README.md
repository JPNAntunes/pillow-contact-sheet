# Pillow Contact Sheet Project

This is a project part of the Python 3 Programming Specialization in Coursera. This project takes one image as an input, and using the pillow library in Python creates a contact sheet that changes the RGB values. 

See the example below to understand, in the first line the Red value was changed, in the second line the Greend value was changed and in the third and final line the Blue value was changed.
